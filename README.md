# intro-algo: Introduction to Algorithms

My notes, code, documentation on "Introduction to Algorithms" (4th edition) by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein (CLRS).

## WIP

This is very much a work in progress as I wrestle my way through the book, and at the same time try to get familiar with the Go programming language... this might take a while :-)
